Dear Dr. Jones,

Please consider our manuscript: "The effect of climate change on sediment organic matter processing in lakes: The role of changing transparency" for publication in Inland Waters.  In this paper we describe how the relationship between lake transparency and thermocline depth can affect the storage of organic matter in arctic lake sediments.  We provide evidence that sediment organic matter breakdown is primarily controlled by temperature and the availability of oxygen and that changes in thermocline depth affect the distribution of oxygen and temperature within the lake.  We evaluate the impact of these relationships by modeling the changes in sediment oxygen demand (as a proxy for organic matter breakdown) that would occur in a well-studied arctic lake under warming and transparency changes predicted to result from climate change.  Our results indicate that warming alone will increase organic matter breakdown but the combined effects of warming and changes in transparency will decrease organic matter breakdown due to the reduction in thermocline depth and the sediment area exposed to warm oxygenated conditions.  Our findings will add to the growing literature that shows that the relationship between lake processes and the predicted effects of climate change are complex. Understanding these complex relationships is necessary as we try to predict the role of lakes in a changing climate.
