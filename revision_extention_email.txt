Dr. Istvanovics,

I am in the process of making the revisions for our paper "The effect of climate change on sediment organic matter processing in lakes: The role of changing
transparency."

You had requested the revisions be completed within 45 days of receiving the reviews, however I still have additional changes to make to complete the revisions. Would it be possible to get a 2 week extension to complete the revised manuscript?

Sincerely,
Kenneth Fortino
